## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Himanshu Bag

As an Software Engineer at Qualcomm, I have developed software and applications using machine learning algorithms and Python programming language. I have contributed to several projects in the fields of natural language processing delivering high-quality and scalable solutions for various business and research needs.

I graduated from NIT Kurukshetra in 2020 with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communications Engineering, where I honed my skills and knowledge in software engineering, data science, and machine learning. I also completed multiple certifications and courses from DataCamp, Coursera, and DeepLearning.AI to enhance my learning and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in these domains.

My goal is to pursue a challenging and rewarding career where I can leverage my skills and interests to solve real-world problems and create value for the organization and the society. I am a quick learner, a strong problem-solver, and a dedicated team player, who is always eager to learn new things and collaborate with others.
